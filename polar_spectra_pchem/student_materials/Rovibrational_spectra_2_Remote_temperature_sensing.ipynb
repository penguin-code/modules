    "We have learned to identify features in downwelling IR spectra due to greenhouse gases ($CO_2$, $H_2O$, $O_3$, and others), and that these features help us measure the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect. We have also learned that in polar regions the spectral features of greenhouse gases are often easier to see than in warmer regions, and that this is because the polar atmosphere is so dry. These observations highlight the unique role offered by polar regions for using downwelling radiance spectra to examine the greenhouse effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this CGI, you'll pursue one such opportunity. There is a band due to $CO_2$, called the $(001) \\to (100)$ band, that is so faint that one needs spectra in polar regions to detect it (remember that there is less interference from water vapor in polar regions). And this band can be used to remotely detect the temperature of the $CO_2$ molecules. It's like a remote thermometer! In doing so, you'll develop a deeper understanding of why climate science is such an interdisciplinary endeavor: in this case, climate scientists must have a command of essential principles of quantum mechanics. More specifically, they need to know something about the _rovibrational structure_ of a spectroscopic band."

    "What is the process underlying the $(001) \\to (100)$ band? The answer involves both vibrational and rotational motions. Let's look at the vibrational part first. The notation here indicates a process in which $CO_2$ molecules undergo a transition, in which a quantum of vibrational energy in the asymmetric stretch mode (designated $001$) is transferred to the symmetric stretch mode (designated $100$). In the process, the molecule releases a photon of infrared light -- the signal detected by our FTIR spectrometer. \n",

    "Figure 1 shows an IR spectrum taken by a ground-based FTIR spectrometer at South Pole Station. The spectrum has been zoomed-in to show the $(001) \\to (100)$ spectral band, an M-shaped feature centered around 960.5 cm$^{-1}$, appearing just to the left of the ozone band. The left-hand hump of the \"M\" is called the _P-Branch_, and the right-hand hump is called the _R-Branch_ of the band.

    "Now let's look at the rotational part of the band. First we'll focus on the frequencies of the lines in the spectrum. For a linear molecule like $CO_2$, the energies of the rotational states are given by $E_J = B \\space J(J+1)$, where $J$ is a positive integer starting at zero, and $B$ is the rotational constant of the molecule. For the $(001) \\to (100)$ band, the spacing between peaks turns out to be $4B$. This is different from other transitions you may have encountered in the past, where the spacing between peaks is just $2B$. So the lines to the right of band center are associated with rotational quantum numbers $1, 3, 5, ...$ of the excited $(001)$ state. Lines to the left are associated with rotational quantum numbers $0, 2, 4, ...$ of the excited state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll tackle the heights of the peaks in the P- and R-Branches. It turns out that temperature has a key influence on those heights. Why is that? Quantum mechanics teaches us that these heights depend on the population (number of molecules) of any given rotational state. The population, in turn, depends on the _degeneracy_ and _energy_ of that rotational state. The degeneracy of rotational states of ${CO}_2$ is given by \n",
