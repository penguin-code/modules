    "There is a broad scientific consensus that emission of fossil fuels by humans is leading to climate change. However, the climate is extremely complicated and understanding climate requires an interdisciplinary effort, with chemistry a key contributor. In this CGI module we will develop chemical ideas, such as the thermodynamics of phase transitions, to help us understand some of the mechanisms of climate change."

    "Human activity has changed the composition of the atmosphere in such a way that the temperature of the planet has increased. Polar regions have undergone greater increases in temperature than midlatitudes, a phenomenon called _polar amplification_. Recent research has also shown that this amplified warming has a significant impact on weather at lower latitudes, causing severe episodes of drought and heavy rainfall in North America and Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Polar connection_  \n",
    "Some of the most difficult observations to collect are in the harsh, remote environments of the polar regions. Yet polar observations are crucial because the unique conditions of polar regions lead to amplification of climate change, a phenomenon called _polar amplification_. Polar ampification, in turn, is largely due to a phenomenon called _ice-albedo feedback_, in which ice and snow, which have a high _albedo_ (they efficiently reflect the sun's rays away from the earth's surface), melt to form melt ponds, which have a low albedo (melt ponds absorb  solar radiation quite well). That, in turn,  warms the surface a little more, which causes more melting, and so on: a _positive feedback_. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this means that sea ice extent in polar regions is an excellent indicator of climate changes resulting from human activity. To that end, climate scientists have taken careful measurements of the seasonal melting and freezing of ice in polar regions, as well as trends in that melting and freezing from year to year. Here, you will examine some of these datasets. "

    "_Sea ice volume and extent_  \n",
    "Sea ice _volume_ is the total volume of sea ice at any given time, usually for a given region. As Fig. 1 shows, sea ice volume varies a lot over a season. During the Arctic winter, because the sun is down 24 hours a day, ice volume steadily builds up. In the spring, the sun  rises high enough in the sky to initiate the melting season.  Melting continues until September, when cold once again sets in, and ice volume begins to increase.\n",

    "One question for climate scientists concerns _how_ Arctic ice melts seasonally. Is more volume lost at the edges, or through thinning of the entire ice cover? It turns out that if you know sea ice volume _and_ extent, then you can also estimate the _thickness_ of the ice. This follows from simple dimensional analysis: volume has dimension $distance^3$, while extent has dimension $distance^2$. So the ratio between them tells you about the thickness.\n",

    "In this CGI, you'll look at some Arctic sea ice data and try to come up with an answer to this question. In doing so, you'll develop familiarity with the seasonal and year-to-year patterns of sea ice growth and melt, as well as skill at visualizing and analyzing the available data. "
