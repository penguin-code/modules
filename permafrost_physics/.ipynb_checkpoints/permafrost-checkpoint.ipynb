    "_Why study climate change in a Physics course?_  \n",
    "In this CGI module we will look at heat flux in the context of a real-world application: climate change. Climate change is arguably one of the greatest challenges we currently face. There is a scientific consensus that emission of fossil fuels by humans is leading to climate change, with serious negative consequences for life on our planet and for all of us. At the same time, the climate is extremely complicated, and understanding it requires an interdisciplinary effort, including chemistry, atmospheric science, geology, and social sciences. Further, scientists study climate through a broad range of observations of the land, atmosphere, and oceans. Some of the most difficult observations to collect are in the harsh, remote environments of the polar regions. Yet polar observations are crucial because the unique conditions of the polar regions lead to amplification of climate change. In this CGI, you will work directly with polar data, using your physics skills to examine the heat flux in permafrost in the Arctic. To allow you to work directly with observed data, you will use Python code. Although you will learn some basics of coding along the way, the Juypter Notebooks should provide a framework to guide you through each step.\n"
